## Introduction

The College ERP System is designed to manage various administrative and academic tasks within a college. This includes student management, course management, faculty management, attendance tracking, and more. The system leverages the MERN stack to provide a robust and scalable solution.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/college-erp
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

4. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The frontend application will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
